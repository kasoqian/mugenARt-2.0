      <br />
      You represent and warrant that, for all such User Content you provide, you
      own or otherwise control all necessary rights to do so and to meet your
      obligations under these Terms of Use. You represent and warrant that such

      <br />
      <span className={styles.title_3}> THE MARKET</span>
      <br />
      When you access and use the Market, we act as an intermediary for Market
      Users to transact, and are not a party to any agreement to buy, sell or
      trade the Assets advertised on the Market. When a User purchases an Asset
      and a User agrees to provide that Asset, they are entering into an
      agreement directly with each other. We do not act as an agent for any
      User.
      <br />
      As we are not a party to the transaction, any interaction between you and
      another User, including any agreement entered into between you and another
      User, is a matter directly between you and them only. Other than our
      obligations set out in these Terms of Use, you agree that we:
      <br />
      are not liable to you for the accuracy of any Listing, or any failure by a
      User to comply with these Terms of Use or any other legal obligation;
      <br />
      are not liable or responsible for any guarantees or assurances made by the
      seller of any listing on the Application;
      <br />
      have not made, and do not make any representation, guarantee or warranty
      that any Asset will meet your requirements or expectations;
      <br />
      are not liable or responsible for any increase or decrease in value of any
      Asset, We have not made, and do not make, any promises (whether explicit,
      implied or otherwise) as to the value of any Asset, including whether the
      value of the Asset will increase or decrease in the future. The Prices of
      collectible assets are volatile and subjective, and we cannot guarantee
      that any Assets purchase will retain any value, which may depend on a
      number of inherently subjective factors beyond our control, including the
      desirability of a particular Asset; and
      <br />
      will not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of other Users
      (including where another User has attempted to defraud you, doesn't have
      the right to sell an Asset to you, or fails to complete a transaction.)
      <br />
      Listing: Where you list an Asset for sale or trade in the Market:
      <br />
      you must only list an Asset that you own in any Listing;
      <br />
      your Listing must be accurate, current, complete and include all the
      relevant information on the Asset. We reserve the right, but are not
      required, to amend any listing to supplement, remove or correct
      information;
      <br />
      your Listing must not be misleading (which includes ensuring no material
      information is left out); and
      <br />
      you accept that, any sale of the Asset will be final, and that you will
      not be able to cancel the sale or retain ownership in the Asset. You enter
      into a legally binding contract to purchase an Asset when you commit to
      buy an Asset at the Price, your offer for an Asset is accepted by the
      seller (whether as a trade for another Asset(s) or for a Price), or if you
      have the winning bid in an auction.
      <br />
      Auctions:
      <br />
      You must only place a bid on an auction if you intend to buy the Asset at
      Price. You cannot revoke a bid once it is placed.
      <br />
      Where an Asset is sold by auction and you place the winning bid, you will
      be obliged to complete the purchase of the Asset at the Price and you will
      not be able to cancel your offer or negotiate a different Price once your
      bid has been lodged.
      <br />
      You agree not to engage in any shill bidding (i.e. placing, or organising
      someone to place, fake bids to manipulate price, desirability or the
      search position of your listing).
      <br />
      Where we reasonably believe that you have engaged in shill bidding, we may
      suspend, or terminate your Account.
      <br />
      Trading: Where you have entered into a trade with another User, that trade
      will be final and you will not be able to cancel the trade or negotiate a
      different trade.
      <br />
      Prices specified on the Market are set by the User offering the Asset for
      sale or trade. Prices are in Gems. We do not make any representation that
      Prices set by Market Users are reasonable or reflect the value of an
      Asset. We will not provide any refunds or reimbursements for any reason.
      <br />
      <span className={styles.title_3}> THE STORE</span>

      If you live in a jurisdiction which allows you to agree to arbitration,
      you agree that any disputes (including the validity or enforceability of
      this arbitration provision) will be settled by binding arbitration, except
      that any party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
